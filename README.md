### Heyy! :D
Hi, I'm Maryam! :D I also use the pseudonym Ruby Phoenix, so you can call me Ruby too. :P

I'm a homeschooled teenager who loves design â€” web design in particular. I'm working to become a full-stack developer. 

Before I decided on web design, I tried a few other things too â€”
* I learned how to make Android apps with Java. I haven't made anything major though.
* I can write Python scripts! :D
* I've learned the basics of SQL, but it's pretty hard imo lol

Right now, I'm working on â€”
* learning how to create Wordpress websites from scratch, and using the Wordpress REST API
* learning [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* mastering Git

My to-learn list includes â€”
* SQL
* MongoDB
* Node.js

**My hobbies**: I really, _really_ love to read lol if you ask me about my favorite books, beware â€” you might get stuck listening for hours :P

You can reach me on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/RubyRedPhoenix/RubyRedPhoenix/discussions/1). I don't have social media, but you can also find me on Khan Academy's Computer Science platform, also as [@RubyRedPhoenix](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/RubyRedPhoenix/)

**Random fact about me:** My favorite color is turquoise.
